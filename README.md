# Changana-Portuguese-Dicionary

This app will help young people in Mozambique learn Portuguese more easily, especially in villages with a weak education system.

This app does not collect, store, or share any personal information of users. No analytics, ads, login, or in-app purchases are used.

I chose to use react native with Expo CLI (not React Native CLI) to make it easier

1. Initialize the basic expo application

npx create-expo-app@latest

2. Login to expo:

npx expo login

3. Start application with Fast Refresh

npx expo start

Obs.: To run sdk Android on windows, I had to install it on another disk, so I should write this env:
$env:ANDROID_HOME="D:\\AndroidStudioSdk"
